About

The primary goal of the project is to design and develop a cross-platform learning app for children who are blind. The app is being built from the ground up using Qt for Python (specifically PySide6), with a focus on leveraging accessibility features of both Qt and the underlying platforms to ensure a seamless and inclusive user experience.
